# Nocode functions: the repo holding i/o processes

In this "parent" repo for all i/o processes, you will find:

- the data structure (the model) common to all i/o functions. Please visit the folder "[DataImportModel](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions-io/tree/main/DataImportModel)".

- the file 'pom.xml' which defines the versions of all the dependencies shared by the io processes
